#### **Independent Project**
###### I created this connect 4 game using python3 and visual studio code. I followed along closely to youtube videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYgyRArKDEs ,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD-Xuu_Jpe4 , and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDz3P_Ctm7U created by Keith Galli. He used Python3 and Sublime Text in the video. All psuedocode is my own to track what I am doing and review for practice. The code itself is the code used in the youtube video.
